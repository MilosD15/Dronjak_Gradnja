# Dronjak_Gradnja
Website for a firm that provides painting services, electrical work services, gypsum work services and a lot more...

I made this website without any js library or any framework, because I want to verify my HTML, CSS, JS knowledge, before I start to learn and make projects with libraries and frameworks. I used only fontawesome for icons, smtp.js for sending emails and intersection observer for scrolling animations.

Draggable slider, zooming in and zooming out images, using intersection observer for full page onscroll animations are just a some of interesting things to see.

I have to note that idea for draggable slider is taken from Traversy Media channel (YouTube).

Considering that all is made with Vanilla JS and pure CSS, it can be interesting to take a look...
